# Spacecraft-Design-for-Jovian-Missions
High-fidelity simulation of a Ganymede polar orbiter using TudatPy to model multi-body gravity and radiation pressure. Integrated with SPENVIS/JOSE to characterize the Jovian electron radiation environment and calculate the optimal aluminum shielding thickness required for mission survival.
